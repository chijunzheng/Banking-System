# Banking-System


This is a multi-functional banking application that allows account holders to manage their accounts securely. The application stores all transactional details and customer information in files for easy access and retrieval.

The application features a login system that ensures secure access to accounts, with two types of login: normal user and administrator. Administrators have password-protected access to add, delete, modify, or search for specific account details.

Once logged in, account holders can perform a variety of transactions, including deposit, withdraw, and balance enquiry. The View Details option provides a comprehensive view of account information, while the Exit option safely logs out the user.

The project is built with Git for version control, Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, and Docker for containerization. You can find the source code and project documentation in this repository.
